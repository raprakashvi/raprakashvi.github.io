    <h3 class="section-title">Mentoring Summary</h3>
    <p>I believe in learning by doing. At Duke, I have been supported by a Laboratory and Curriculum Development Fellowship from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science during my master's studies. The fellowship allowed me to work with <a href="https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/george-delagrammatikas">Prof. George Delagrammatikas</a> to design and build Duke's latest prototyping space "Garage Lab". Check out their <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/memscapstone/">awesome work</a>.</p>
