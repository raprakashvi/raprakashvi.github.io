<p> I belive in learning by doing. At Duke, I have been supported by Laboratory and Curriculum Development Fellowship from the Department of Mechanican Engineering and Materials Science during my master's study. The fellowship allowed me to work with <a href ="https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/george-delagrammatikas" >Prof. George Delagrammatikas</a> to design and build Duke's latest prototyping space "Garage Lab". <br><br>


As a teaching assisant for "Experiment Design & Research Methods" course, I worked with graduate students from various backgrounds to help develop protoyping and experiment design skills over a semester long course. The experience has helped me develop my skills to work "with" the students and assist with suggestions to complete the milestones within a semester.
