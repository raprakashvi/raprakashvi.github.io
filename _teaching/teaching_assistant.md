<h3> <u>Mentoring Summary</u></h3>
<p> I belive in learning by doing. At Duke, I have been supported by Laboratory and Curriculum Development Fellowship from the Department of Mechanican Engineering and Materials Science during my master's studies. The fellowship allowed me to work with <a href ="https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/george-delagrammatikas" >Prof. George Delagrammatikas</a> to design and build Duke's latest prototyping space "Garage Lab". Check out their <a href = "https://sites.duke.edu/memscapstone/">awesome work</a>. <br><br>

<h3><u>Students Mentored </u></h3>
<ol>
<li> Zacharias Chen, Junior </li>

<li> Mahi Patel, Sophomore</li>

<li> Changxin Yu, MS
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
  <li> "A Deep Learning Pipeline for Unsupervised OCT Image Segmentation". 3rd prize in the Department's MS poster symposium. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3> <u> Teaching Experience </u> </h3>
As a teaching assisant for "Experiment Design & Research Methods" course, I worked with graduate students from various backgrounds to help develop protoyping and experiment design skills over a semester long course. The experience has helped me develop my skills to work "with" the students and assist with suggestions to complete the milestones within a semester.
