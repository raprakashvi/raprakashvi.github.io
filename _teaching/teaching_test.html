    <h3 class="section-title">Mentoring Summary</h3>
    <p>I believe in learning by doing. At Duke, I have been supported by a Laboratory and Curriculum Development Fellowship from the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science during my master's studies. The fellowship allowed me to work with <a href="https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/george-delagrammatikas">Prof. George Delagrammatikas</a> to design and build Duke's latest prototyping space "Garage Lab". Check out their <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/memscapstone/">awesome work</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Teaching Experience</h3>
    <p>As a teaching assistant for "Experiment Design & Research Methods" course, I worked with graduate students from various backgrounds to help develop prototyping and experiment design skills over a semester-long course. The experience has helped me develop my skills to work "with" the students and assist with suggestions to complete the milestones within a semester.</p>
