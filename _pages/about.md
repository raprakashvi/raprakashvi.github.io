<font size = "3"> <p> I am a doctoral researcher in <a href="https://www.braintoollab.com/">Brain Tool Lab</a> with <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/patrick.codd">Patrick Codd </a> and <a href="http://boyuanchen.com/">Boyuan Chen</a> developing technologies towards automated brain surgery. My research focuses on Robotic Perception, Soft Body Manipulation and Machine Learning. I obtained my MS in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://duke.edu/"> Duke University</a> with <a href="http://ni.pratt.duke.edu/"> Xiaoyue Ni </a> with focus on flexible epidermal sensors for physiological sensing. </p>

<p>My interests lies in developing interventions in healthcare for enhancing ability and accessibility of autonomous systems by equipping them with novel sensors and algorithms. Through my work, I wish to empower healthcare professionals by developing better surgical robotic systems and sensors which not only improve patient's clinical experience but also increases clinician's reach. This will help address the challenges faced by under-resourced communities and push us towards a equitable present and future.</p> </font>
