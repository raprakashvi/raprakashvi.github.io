I am a doctoral researcher in [Brain Tool Lab](https://www.braintoollab.com/) with [Patrick Codd](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/patrick.codd)  where I work on developing technologies towards automated brain surgery. My research focuses on Robotic Perception, Soft Body Manipulation and Machine Learning. I obtained my MS in Mechanical Engineering at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) with [Xiaoyue Ni](http://ni.pratt.duke.edu/).

My interests lies in developing interventions in healthcare for enhancing ability and accessibility of autonomous systems by equipping them with novel sensors and algorithms. Through my work, I wish to empower healthcare professionals in under-resourced communities for a equitable present and future.
