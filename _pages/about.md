<!-- # About Me -->

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Brain Tool Lab](https://www.braintoollab.com/) under the mentorship of [Patrick Codd](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/patrick.codd) and [Boyuan Chen](http://boyuanchen.com/), where I develop cutting-edge technologies aimed at advancing automated surgery. My research encompasses **Robotic Perception**, **Surgical Robotics Platforms**, and **Machine Learning**. I hold an MS in Mechanical Engineering from [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), where I worked with [Xiaoyue Ni](http://ni.pratt.duke.edu/) on flexible epidermal sensors for physiological sensing.

My passion lies in creating transformative healthcare interventions by enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems through innovative sensors and algorithms. I aim to empower healthcare professionals with advanced surgical robotic systems and sensors, improving clinical outcomes and accessibility. My work is committed to addressing the challenges faced by under-resourced communities, striving for a more equitable healthcare future.
